   * If we can only traverse l once and we don't want to do any
   * multiplications until we have checked that there are no 0s
   * in the whole list, then we have to "save" the elements
   * without multiplying as we walk through the list.
   * 
   * One approach is to change the Int accumulator into, say,
   * a List[Int], essentially "caching locally" the input
   * stream until we have seen the whole stream.  When we
   * reach the end of the stream (i.e., Nil), then we 
   * do the multiplication (using any of the functions
   * above).  This is essentially traversing l twice.
   * 
   * We adopt a slight twist of the above.  Instead of
   * "caching locally" in a List[Int], we cache in a function
   * Int => Int.  Whoa, we are using functions as a data structure
   * (repeat: "functions are values").
   * 
   * Let's for the moment ignore the "stop early" on 0 and focus
   * on accumulating a function that suspends "what should be done."
   * 
   * No multiplications happen until we get to the end of the input
   * list l where we have decided to actually "do it" (i.e., do the
   * the multiplications).  We have essentially "cached" the elements
   * of l inside sc but also packaged the "multiplying actions" with
   * the elements.
   * 
   * Stepping back, we see that mulListDelayed is exactly the
   * continuation-passing style version of mulListDirect.  In
   * mulListDirect, the "cached" elements of l are on the
   * stack of activation records.
   * 
   * Remember that "continuation" is just the term for
   * a callback for "myself."
